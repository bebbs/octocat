Branches are versions of a set of code. When you create a repository you are working on the 'master branch'. If you choose to separate your code, to work on different features without interfering with the stable master branch, you can create a new branch, which is a snapshot copy of the current codebase. This branch now exists independently of the master, and any changes you make to each would not affect the other. You can merge branches into eachother to combine everything back to a master branch.
